The line from this week's simulation and network models study caught my attention again because it demonstrated how modeling and surviving evidence share common characteristics.
The process of modeling and surviving evidence reveals their shared nature as incomplete information which depends on various assumptions.
The archaeological record shows evidence of survival and discovery processes which match the simulation rules that determine its output.
The two methods function as tools to explore possible outcomes instead of establishing absolute truth.

The virus-on-a-network model results showed that modifying the fear level of people during travel would produce entirely different simulation outcomes.
The absence of surviving nodes in historical records makes it impossible to detect complete chains of cause and effect.
The connection between this concept and previous discussions about data interpretation remains unclear to me but it appears to share similarities with previous discussions about data interpretation.
The model demonstrated that all data contains missing information which affects its final form.

The foraging model introduced new perspectives about how people make decisions.
The model demonstrated how individual choices at the local level produced unexpected patterns which included resource depletion and unintentional resource management.
The simulation process helped me understand how individual decisions create extensive social systems which archaeologists study through settlement patterns and trade networks.

The ORBIS Roman communication network map revealed its complex nature to me even though it appeared as a basic geographical representation.
The process of message and goods transportation between cities helped me understand how evidence travels through time because of survival rates and decay processes and discovery outcomes.
The authors of ORBIS explain that the model functions to combine with historical data instead of predicting future events (Scheidel, Weiland & Arcen√°s 2014).
These tools function as testing mechanisms which evaluate concepts against existing evidence rather than replacing it.

The new approach requires me to develop my skills in using this method.
The agent-based and network concepts remain unfamiliar to me because I struggle to understand the code and its intended meaning.
The method requires me to explicitly state my assumptions which I find beneficial.
The class has shown me how weak our interpretations become when we analyze them which I had not understood before this course.

Simulation serves to investigate multiple possible solutions which depend on the specific conditions we select for study just as archaeological evidence depends on surviving artifacts.
