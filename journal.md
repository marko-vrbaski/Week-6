The models' operational mechanisms became difficult to understand during this week's work.

The virus model parameters remained unclear to me until I understood the function of the "fear" variable.
I used print statements together with brief model tests to observe how different input values affected disease transmission.

The foraging model agents continued to gather at the same location which became my main challenge.
The model behavior changed after I modified the regeneration rates which solved the problem.

The ORBIS network proved to be the most challenging to understand because the provided dataset contained abstract information.
The process of watching nodes and edges update through the system allowed me to understand what was occurring.

Each variable in the model functions as an behavioral assumption which provides both the advantages and disadvantages of this modeling approach.
The modeling approach enables me to test different scenarios through number adjustments yet it demonstrates how small changes in numbers can transform the entire model outcome.

I plan to improve my ability to link model observations with reading content through the addition of brief citations to my journal according to my professor's recommendation.
The practice of adding citations to my journal entries will enhance my reflection quality and create better foundations for future work.
